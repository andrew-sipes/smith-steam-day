          Macaws are vibrant and majestic parrots known for their colorful
          plumage and sociable nature. These large birds are native to Central
          and South America, where they inhabit forests and woodlands. Macaws
          are highly intelligent, often forming strong bonds with their human
          caretakers. They are also renowned for their loud vocalizations, which
          serve both as communication and as a way to establish their territory.
          Macaws have impressive lifespans and can live up to 60 years in
          captivity, making them popular pets among bird enthusiasts.
