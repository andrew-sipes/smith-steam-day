        Lions are majestic carnivores known for their fierce demeanor and iconic
        mane. They are part of the big cat family and are the only social cats,
        living in prides consisting of related females and their young, along
        with a few dominant males. These powerful predators are primarily found
        in Africa's savannas, where they hunt together to take down large prey
        such as zebras and buffalo.

        Male lions are easily recognized by their impressive manes, which serve
        as a sign of their strength and dominance. Despite their reputation as
        fierce hunters, lions spend a significant amount of time resting and
        conserving energy, with females primarily responsible for hunting. The
        roar of a lion can be heard up to 5 miles away, serving as a territorial
        call and a means of communication within the pride. Lions face threats
        from habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict but remain a symbol of
        strength and resilience in the animal kingdom.
