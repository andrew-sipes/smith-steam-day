      <h2>Behavior</h2>
      <p>
        Penguins exhibit fascinating behavior both on land and in the water.
        These flightless birds are highly adapted for aquatic life, excelling in
        swimming and diving. Socially, they form large colonies for breeding,
        displaying strong mate fidelity and engaging in complex courtship
        rituals. Penguins communicate through vocalizations, postures, and
        displays to establish territories and bond with their mates.

        Parental care is central to penguin behavior, with both parents sharing
        responsibilities such as incubating eggs and feeding the chicks.
        Penguins also exhibit hierarchy within colonies, with dominant
        individuals often defending their territories and mates. Their communal
        lifestyle helps protect them against predators and harsh environmental
        conditions, showcasing the importance of unity in their survival
        strategies.
